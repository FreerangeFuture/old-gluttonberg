h1. Extensions

Extensions to Gluttonberg come in two forms. The first is custom code living 
in controllers and libs. In general, this is code written on a project by
project basis. For example you might create a custom contact form for a 
client.

The second form of extensions add additional functionality to Gluttonberg 
itself and will usually take the form of merb-slices e.g. a forum, web-shop,
photo gallery.

For extensions that don't expose a UI — and therefore don’t need controllers 
or views — they may be packaged simply as gems.
