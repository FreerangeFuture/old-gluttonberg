h1. Localization

There are intended to be two levels for localization in Gluttonberg. The first
is localizing the editable contents in the database â€” which end-users 
maintain. The second involves localizing formats for dates/times, currency and
common strings to be used across the site e.g. "ok", "cancel", "error".
