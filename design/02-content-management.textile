h1. Content Management

This is the core of the application. At a bare minimum the CMS needs to
provide some way for users to add and edit content and arrange pages within
their site.

h2. Pages

Pages are the core of the content management. They represent each page that 
appears in the navigation of a website and act as the container which holds
the editable content.

They also act as a way to expose controllers publicly, which will be 
explained in a later section; Extensions.

h3. Meta Data

Each page has the following details associated with it:
  
* Name - to be displayed in page titles
* Navigation label - Shortened title to be used in the nav
* Slug - used when building the URL to a page

h3. Localization

All details related to the pages themselves can be localized. This includes 
the page title, the slug and the navigation label.

The actual content of the pages themselves are also localized, which is 
discussed a little later in this section.
