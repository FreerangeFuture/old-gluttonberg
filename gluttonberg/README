Gluttonberg
===========

A slice for the Merb framework which provides the core components of a 
content management system; content editing, asset management and 
authentication. It will be built in such a way as to allow extensions to be
added without having to modify the core library and without being limited to
a narrow API. Instead additional code is added in exactly the same way as any
other Merb app, but is given access to the CMS's API i.e. for authentication.

It's in a minimal state currently, but we have detailed our development plans
here: http://github.com/lukesutton/gluttonberg/wikis

Contributing
============

Here are the things you need to know to started contributing to Gluttonberg.

Firstly, there are a whole bunch of dependencies, so make sure you have all 
of these gems installed. Gems like merb should install their own deps like 
haml.

  * merb (0.9.12)
  * dm-adjust (0.9.6)
  * dm-aggregates (0.9.6)
  * dm-core (0.9.6)
  * dm-is-list (0.9.6)
  * dm-is-tree (0.9.6)
  * dm-observer (0.9.6)
  * dm-sweatshop (0.9.6)
  * dm-timestamps (0.9.6)
  * dm-types (0.9.6)
  * dm-validations (0.9.6)
  
Next, you need to migrate the app. This is a bit of a pest since we donâ€™t have
a rake task yet. Firstly make a db directory inside the slice. Then start up
an interactive merb session and auto migrate DataMapper.

  $ slice -i
  $ DataMapper.auto_migrate!
  
Now, if you run the slice command normally the app should boot up as expected. 
Yay!
