Gluttonberg
===========

A slice for the Merb framework which provides the core components of a 
content management system; content editing, asset management and 
authentication. It will be built in such a way as to allow extensions to be
added without having to modify the core library and without being limited to
a narrow API. Instead additional code is added in exactly the same way as any
other Merb app, but is given access to the CMS's API i.e. for authentication.

It's in a minimal state currently, but we have detailed our development plans
