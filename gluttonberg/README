Gluttonberg
===========

A slice for the Merb framework which provides the core components of a 
content management system; content editing, asset management and 
authentication. It will be built in such a way as to allow extensions to be
added without having to modify the core library and without being limited to
a narrow API. Instead additional code is added in exactly the same way as any
other Merb app, but is given access to the CMS's API i.e. for authentication.

It's in a minimal state currently, but we have detailed our development plans
here: http://github.com/lukesutton/gluttonberg/wikis

Contributing
============

Here are the things you need to know to started contributing to Gluttonberg.

Firstly, there are some dependencies, so make sure you have all 
of these gems installed. Gems like merb should install their own deps like 
haml. You need to install these exact versions.

If you want the full merb stack:
  * merb (1.0)
  * dm-adjust (0.9.6)
  * dm-is-list (0.9.6)
  * dm-is-tree (0.9.6)
  * dm-observer (0.9.6)
  * RedCloth (4.1.0)
  * mongrel (1.1.5)
  * webrat (0.3.2)
  * echoe (3.0.2)

If you want a minimal merb install:
  * merb-core (1.0)
  * merb-assets (1.0)
  * merb-helpers (1.0)
  * merb_datamapper (1.0)
  * merb-auth-core (1.0)
  * merb-auth-more (1.0)
  * merb-haml (1.0)
  * dm-adjust (0.9.6)
  * dm-aggregates (0.9.6)
  * dm-core (0.9.6)
  * dm-is-list (0.9.6)
  * dm-is-tree (0.9.6)
  * dm-observer (0.9.6)
  * dm-sweatshop (0.9.6)
  * dm-timestamps (0.9.6)
  * dm-types (0.9.6)
  * dm-validations (0.9.6)
  * RedCloth (4.1.0)
  * mongrel (1.1.5)
  * webrat (0.3.2)
  * echoe (3.0.2)

Next, you need to migrate the app. This is a bit of a pest since we donâ€™t have
a rake task yet. Firstly make a db directory inside the slice. Then start up
an interactive merb session and auto migrate DataMapper.

  $ slice -i
  $ DataMapper.auto_migrate!
  $ Gluttonberg::User.create({:name => 'admin', :email => 'admin@localhost.localdomain', :password => 'password', :password_confirmation => 'password'})

This migrates the database to create the tables and then creates an initial user
to be able to login with.

Now, if you run the slice command normally the app should boot up as expected. 
Yay!

  $ slice

Notes for Ubuntu Linux
======================
Merb 1.0 requires that you use Ruby Gems version 1.3 or later, this is not included
in the default packages in Ubuntu 8.10 or earlier. You will need to download the
latest Ruby Gems and install it.

Merb also uses SQLite3 and need the header files installed so make sure you have the
package libsqlite3-dev installed. (SQLite3 is installed by default in 8.10 but not the
header files required to build native extensions.)

Gluttonberg uses webrat which uses nokogiri which uses libxml, so you need to install the 
libxml-ruby, libxslt-ruby, libxslt1-dev and libxml2-dev package as well.
