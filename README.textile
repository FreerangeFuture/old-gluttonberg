h1. Gluttonberg - A Content Management System

This is an open source content management system being developed by 
"Freerange Future":http://www.freerangefuture.com

Our basic philosophy for this CMS is that it shouldnâ€™t try to be everything 
to everybody. Rather, it should provide the basic components needed for 
content management, a small and simple API for additional components, 
authentication etc. and otherwise just stay out of the way. 

Most importantly, you should be able to extend it with custom code on a 
per-project basis without it making you cry.

It's built on top of Merb and DataMapper. It is not ORM-agnostic and will 
never be. Soz :)

h2. Learning More

We have the beginnings of a roadmap in the Git repo. It's stored in the design
directory. You can read it online "at github.":http://github.com/lukesutton/gluttonberg/tree/master/design
It describes the basic philosophy behind the project and then details the 
planned implementation for it's various features

h2. Helping

Firstly, YES PLEASE :) We've got a whole bunch of good ideas for developing
this CMS and would love to have other people pitch in. Commit access is given
freely, no questions asked.

If you're interested, send a message to lukesutton through Github.

Any bugs can be posted on "our lighthouse project.":http://freerangefuture.lighthouseapp.com/projects/17110-gluttonberg/overview
